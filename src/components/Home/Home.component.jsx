              <p>I studied Software Engineering at the University of Edinburgh on a Mastercard Foundation Scholarship. I am a software engineer at BlackRock in the Portfolio Management division wherein I develop libraries for microservices. I enjoy programming across the computing stack: compilers, messaging systems, containers, back-end services, middleware, front-ends and machine learning.</p>
              <p>I'm interested in studying systems for machine learning, most especially methods involved in making the underlying frameworks more performant and scalable.</p>
              <p>You can find some of my hobby projects <a href="https://github.com/hoffmann-muki">here</a>.</p>
              <p>In addition to programming, I like reading books of all sorts: memoirs, startups, organizational management, philosophy and personal development.</p>
